## 🌟 Special Features

### 🥧 Interactive Spending Breakdown (Pie Chart)

Spendify includes an intuitive pie chart feature that helps users instantly visualize how their money is being spent. Instead of combing through endless numbers or spreadsheets, users get a clear, color-coded breakdown of expenses by category — all in one glance.

#### 🔍 How It Works
As users log expenses into Spendify, the app automatically categorizes and calculates totals. These figures are then translated into a live pie chart, where each slice represents a spending category (e.g., **Food**, **Transport**, **Bills**). The chart updates in real-time as new data is added or modified.

#### ✅ Key Benefits
- Instantly see where money goes each month  
- Easily identify overspending patterns and budget imbalances  
- Simplifies complex data into an easy-to-understand visual  
- Makes the user interface more engaging with dynamic color feedback

#### ✅ Key Benefits
