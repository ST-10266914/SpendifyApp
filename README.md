🌟 Special Features
🥧 Interactive Spending Breakdown (Pie Chart)
Spendify includes an intuitive pie chart feature that helps users instantly visualize how their money is being spent. Instead of combing through endless numbers or spreadsheets, users get a clear, color-coded breakdown of expenses by category — all in one glance.

🔍 How it works:
As users log expenses into Spendify, the app automatically categorizes and calculates totals. These figures are then translated into a live pie chart, where each slice represents a spending category (e.g., Food, Transport, Bills). The chart updates in real time as new data is added or modified.

✅ What it does:

Provides a fast, visual summary of where money goes each month.

Helps identify overspending patterns and budget imbalances.

Makes complex data easy to understand, even for non-technical users.

Enhances the user experience with dynamic and colorful visual feedback.

This feature is ideal for users who prefer seeing the big picture instead of digging into line-by-line reports.

📄 On-Demand Report Generator
Spendify comes with a powerful report generation tool that turns your spending data into organized, shareable reports — all with a single tap. Whether for personal tracking, budgeting, or sharing with an advisor, this tool is built to simplify your financial overview.

🔍 How it works:
When users select the "Generate Report" option, Spendify compiles all logged expenses, totals, and any insights into a well-formatted report. Depending on the setup, the report may include summaries, date ranges, and pie chart snapshots, all exported into a file (such as PDF or plain text).

✅ What it does:

Automates financial report creation — no need for spreadsheets.

Creates clean, printable summaries for offline use.

Useful for budgeting, expense reviews, or record-keeping.

Reports can be stored, shared, or printed directly from the app.

This feature is especially useful for users who need monthly overviews or want to keep a documented history of their financial habits.
