🌟 Special Features
🥧 Interactive Spending Breakdown (Pie Chart)
Spendify includes an intuitive pie chart feature that helps users instantly visualize how their money is being spent. Instead of combing through endless numbers or spreadsheets, users get a clear, color-coded breakdown of expenses by category — all in one glance.

🔍 How It Works
As users log expenses into Spendify, the app automatically categorizes and calculates totals. These figures are then translated into a live pie chart, where each slice represents a spending category (e.g., Food, Transport, Bills). The chart updates in real-time as new data is added or modified.

✅ Key Benefits
Instantly see where money goes each month

Easily identify overspending patterns and budget imbalances

Simplifies complex data into an easy-to-understand visual

Makes the user interface more engaging with dynamic color feedback

This feature is perfect for users who want to understand their financial habits at a glance — no spreadsheets required.

📄 On-Demand Report Generator
Spendify comes with a built-in reporting tool that turns your financial data into clean, shareable summaries. Whether you’re reviewing your monthly budget, sharing with an advisor, or keeping records, this tool makes it effortless.

🔍 How It Works
When the "Generate Report" button is clicked, Spendify compiles all relevant data — including categorized expenses, totals, and visual summaries — into a downloadable format such as PDF or plain text. Reports may also include date filters and pie chart snapshots (if enabled).
